## Part-of-speech tagging text

In text mining it can be useful to extract words that have a particular part of speech (POS) such as a noun or a verb. For example extracting all proper nouns can give use names and locations. This is done using a POS-tagger. The POS-tag of a word is a label of the word indicating its part of speech as well as grammatical categories such as tense, number (plural/singular) and case. POS tagging is the process of automatically determining the POS-tags of the tokens in a corpus.

In this lesson, we will use NLTKâ€™s ```averaged_perceptron_tagger``` as the POS-tagger. It uses the perceptron algorithm to predict which POS-tag is most likely given the word.  We need to download the tagger in order to use it.

The POS-tagger outputs tokens tagged with their POS-tag.  It uses the [Penn Treebank POS tagset](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html) which is widely used for POS-tagging text.

POS-tagging text is very useful when analysing a corpus or document and will allow us to do more indepth analysis and visualisations.  In order to pos-tag using NLTK, you also have to import ```pos_tag```  from the ```tag``` package.

We are going to use the text from the US Presidential Inaugaral speeches. This is a data set that we can download from NLTK.


```python
import nltk
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
from nltk.tag import pos_tag
nltk.download('inaugural')
from nltk.corpus import inaugural
```

    [nltk_data] Downloading package averaged_perceptron_tagger to
    [nltk_data]     /Users/<USERNAME>/nltk_data...

This corpus comes in raw format but also pre-tokenised. Therefore we can call the ```words()``` method to retrieve the tokenised text of all speeches.


```python
inaugural_tokens=inaugural.words()
print(inaugural_tokens)
```

    ['Fellow', '-', 'Citizens', 'of', 'the', 'Senate', ...]


We can look at the tokens from the last inaugural, the one made by President Trump, by looking at the last member of the list of speeches using the ```fileids()``` method.


```python
inaugural_tokens_trump = inaugural.words(inaugural.fileids()[0:-1])
print(inaugural_tokens_trump)
```

    ['Fellow', '-', 'Citizens', 'of', 'the', 'Senate', ...]


We can assign POS-tags to all speeches using NLTK's ```pos_tag()``` method and view the first 20:


```python
tagged_inaugural_tokens = nltk.pos_tag(inaugural_tokens)
tagged_inaugural_tokens[:20]
```




    [('Fellow', 'NNP'),
     ('-', ':'),
     ('Citizens', 'NNS'),
     ('of', 'IN'),
     ('the', 'DT'),
     ('Senate', 'NNP'),
     ('and', 'CC'),
     ('of', 'IN'),
     ('the', 'DT'),
     ('House', 'NNP'),
     ('of', 'IN'),
     ('Representatives', 'NNPS'),
     (':', ':'),
     ('Among', 'IN'),
     ('the', 'DT'),
     ('vicissitudes', 'NNS'),
     ('incident', 'NN'),
     ('to', 'TO'),
     ('life', 'NN'),
     ('no', 'DT')]



We can then set up lists to hold specific parts of speech such as nouns. Firstly we set up an empty list and the we search for the nouns, NN singular and NNS plural. We can then print the first 20:


```python
nouns = [] 
nouns = [word for (word, pos) in tagged_inaugural_tokens if (pos == 'NN' or pos == 'NNS')] 
nouns[:20]
```




    ['Citizens',
     'vicissitudes',
     'incident',
     'life',
     'event',
     'anxieties',
     'notification',
     'order',
     'day',
     'month',
     'hand',
     'Country',
     'voice',
     'veneration',
     'love',
     'retreat',
     'predilection',
     'flattering',
     'hopes',
     'decision']



Now that we have created this list of nouns, we can plot their counts in the corpus as we did yesterday (see lesson on frequency counts).


```python
from nltk.probability import FreqDist
fdist = FreqDist(nouns)
fdist.plot(30,title='Frequency distribution for 30 most common nouns in the inaugural corpus')
```

We can also plot the nouns as a word cloud like we did yesterday (see lesson on Counting tokens in text):


```python
from wordcloud import WordCloud
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
cloud = WordCloud(max_font_size=60,colormap="hsv").generate(' '.join(nouns))
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (16,12)
plt.imshow(cloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```
